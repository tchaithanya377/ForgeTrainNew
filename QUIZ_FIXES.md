# Quiz System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Quiz Completion Not Being Saved to Supabase
**Problem**: After taking a quiz and scoring 70% or higher, the completion status was not being saved to the database, causing the UI to still show "Take the quiz" instead of showing it as completed.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper quiz attempt tracking in `QuizTakingPage.tsx`
- Created `quiz_attempts` table to store quiz results
- Enhanced existing `user_progress` table with additional columns for quiz tracking
- Implemented proper database insertion with error handling
- Added query invalidation to refresh UI after completion

### 2. Camera/Microphone Not Being Released
**Problem**: After exiting the quiz, the camera and microphone were still being used, causing privacy concerns and potential browser warnings.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `cleanupSecuritySystems()` function in `AdvancedSecurityMonitor.tsx`
- Added proper media track stopping with logging
- Improved audio context cleanup with error handling
- Added media recorder cleanup
- Implemented state reset for all security monitoring
- Added multiple cleanup effects to ensure proper resource release

### 3. Quiz Status Not Updating in UI
**Problem**: The course learning page and quiz components were not properly displaying completion status.

**Solution**:
- Added user progress and quiz attempts queries in `CourseLearningPage.tsx`
- Updated `QuizComponent.tsx` to fetch and display actual completion status
- Implemented proper completion status mapping
- Added real-time UI updates after quiz completion

## Database Changes

### New Table Created

#### `quiz_attempts`
```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_attempts (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  quiz_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES quizzes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (score >= 0 AND score <= 100),
  passed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  time_spent_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  answers JSONB,
  security_data JSONB,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Enhanced Existing Table

#### `user_progress` (Enhanced)
The existing `user_progress` table was enhanced with additional columns:
- `completed` - Boolean flag for completion status
- `score` - Integer score (0-100)
- `completed_at` - Timestamp when completed
- `lesson_type` - Type of lesson (text_tutorial, video_tutorial, quiz, code_challenge)
- `module_id` - Reference to module
- `lesson_id` - Reference to specific lesson

### New Files Created

1. **`supabase/migrations/001_create_quiz_tables.sql`**
   - Database migration for quiz tracking table
   - Enhanced existing user_progress table with additional columns
   - RLS policies for security
   - Indexes for performance
   - Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view their own quiz attempts and progress
- Proper authentication checks for all operations
- Secure data access patterns

### Media Resource Management
- Proper camera and microphone cleanup
- Error handling for media operations
- Multiple cleanup points to ensure resource release

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Take a quiz and score 70% or higher
- [ ] Verify quiz completion is saved to database
- [ ] Verify UI shows quiz as completed
- [ ] Verify camera/microphone are released after quiz
- [ ] Verify completion status persists after page refresh
- [ ] Test quiz retake functionality
- [ ] Test navigation away from quiz during progress
- [ ] Verify security monitoring cleanup on quiz exit

## Performance Considerations

- Added database indexes for better query performance
- Implemented query invalidation for real-time updates
- Added proper error handling to prevent crashes
- Optimized cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks

## Database Migration Notes

The migration is designed to work with your existing schema:
- Creates new `quiz_attempts` table for detailed quiz tracking
- Enhances existing `user_progress` table with additional columns
- Uses conditional logic to avoid conflicts with existing structure
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Future Improvements

1. Add quiz analytics and reporting
2. Implement quiz time tracking and analytics
3. Add quiz sharing and social features
4. Implement advanced security monitoring features
5. Add quiz templates and customization options
